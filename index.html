            <p>Your dreams take many forms, and often they’re goals that you want to achieve. These goals can become life goals, which are often ways to reach success you’ve always dreamed of. It’s not always easy balancing life goals with other things you want to accomplish, but with enough effort and focus, you can make it happen.</p>
